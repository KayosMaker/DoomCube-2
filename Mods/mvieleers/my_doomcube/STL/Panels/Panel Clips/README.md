#### Both STL's in this directory are a MOD of the [panel clips for 2020 extrusions by Annex Engineering](https://github.com/Annex-Engineering/Annex-Engineering_Other_Printer_Mods/tree/master/All_Printers/Annex_Panel_2020_Clips_and_Hinges/panel_clips_and_corners)
Pleae take note of [the Annex Engineering EULA](LICENSE.md).
As required the CAD files are provided as well.

### The Mod
Usually the panel clips are used to mount a panel on top of an extrusion frame. In my use case I wanna hold an extrusion frame within an extrusion frame in place. Therefor these panel clips are flattened.

### External files
The panel clips require a "key". You can use the official [3mm assymetric key by Annex Engineering](https://github.com/Annex-Engineering/Annex-Engineering_Other_Printer_Mods/blob/master/All_Printers/Annex_Panel_2020_Clips_and_Hinges/panel_clips_and_corners/key/STL/key_asymmetric_3.STL) for these clips.
